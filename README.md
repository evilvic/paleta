Currently there are very useful and powerful resources that help children write from their first line of code to build games, websites, applications and even program robots. These resources based on block programming are simple and very didactic.

However, the time comes when they face more complicated and intimidating programming languages and the transition can be complicated. **paleta** covers that midpoint and helps in this transition.

**paleta** is a web application that teaches kids the concepts of coding and logic through making beautiful pictures.

# How it works?

In **paleta** we will have two main sections:

1. The Playground is a code editor with visualization of results in real time, in this section a series of simple and intuitive commands are introduced to make amazing art.

2. The Gallery where you can see the works of others and support the learning process.
